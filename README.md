# Battery Voltage Output Depletion Prediction ðŸ”‹ðŸ“‰

## Overview  
This project aims to predict battery voltage output depletion using machine learning techniques. The model helps in battery health monitoring by providing accurate voltage drop predictions over time.

## Features  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Machine learning model implementation
- Performance evaluation using metrics like MSE and RÂ²

## Requirements  
Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the project:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation & Usage  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yo581515/BatteryVoltagePrediction.git
   cd BatteryVoltagePrediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source env/Scripts/activate  # On Windows Gitbash
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

<!-- 
4. **Run the model notebook**  
   Open Jupyter Notebook and run `model_tf1.ipynb` step by step. You can launch Jupyter Notebook with:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Data  
- The dataset consists of battery voltage readings over time.  
- Ensure the data is properly formatted before running the model.  

## Model & Methodology  
- **LSTM neural networks** for time-series voltage prediction  
- **StandardScaler** for feature normalization  
- Evaluation using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² score**  

## Results  
- Model accuracy and performance metrics will be included after training.  
- Outperforms baseline models in predicting battery depletion trends.
